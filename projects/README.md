## DnD Game

This is a text-based Python DnD game by Aiden. We will see if we can embed it in
the Jekyll site but otherwise the files will be available here.

## CRUD API

CRUD stands for

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

And represents the most basic form of a RESTful API. We'll use Python to make a
very simple data store that can be interacted with through HTTP. We can do both
server and client side or use something like Postman to simulate a client.
